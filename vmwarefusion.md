# VMware Fusion Setup Guide for macOS

### Purpose Overview
Broadcom Support Portal registration unlocks official VMware Fusion downloads without entitlements for personal use. This supports creating Windows VMs on macOS seamlessly.
***

## Pre-Registration Hardware Check
Before registering with Broadcom for VMware Fusion, verify your Mac's model and available storage to ensure compatibility and sufficient space for Windows VMs.

### Check Mac Model
Identify your Mac hardware to select the correct VMware Fusion build and Windows architecture.

- Go to **Apple Menu > About This Mac**; note the **Chip** (e.g., Apple M1/M2/M3/M4 = ARM/Apple Silicon) or **Processor** (Intel Core i5/i7/etc. = x64).
- Intel Macs require **x64 (Intel 64-bit)** Windows ISOs and universal Fusion builds.
- Apple Silicon Macs (M-series) need **ARM64** Windows 11 ISOs (x64 won't boot).

## Storage Requirements
Allocate adequate SSD space for smooth VM performance.

- **Minimum**: 64GB total free space (VMware Fusion ~1GB + Windows VM 50GB + apps/updates).
- **Recommended**: If your laptop has 512GB SSD, it is good to create VM for good performance.
- Check via **Apple Menu > About This Mac > Storage** or **Finder > Go > Computer**.

## Pre-Registration Checklist
| Check | Intel Mac | Apple Silicon Mac | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Model** | Intel Core iX | Apple M1/M2/M3/M4 | Determines Windows arch |
| **RAM** | 8GB+ | 16GB+ unified | VMs consume host RAM |
| **Storage** | 64GB+ free | 64GB+ free | Host + Guest allocation |
| **Windows ISO** | x64 (Win 10/11) | ARM64 (Win 11 only) | Download separately |
| **Fusion Build** | Universal .dmg | Universal .dmg | Works on both   |

This prevents download/install issues and ensures Windows VM creation succeeds post-Fusion setup.
